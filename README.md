# Foundation Sites Grid Only

Build configuration that generates just the xy-grid from the Foundation library along with the css flex classes helpers. Details about the xy-grid can be found here https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/xy-grid.html.

## Setup

Running `npm run build` will output the generated css into the `build` folder using the original source files.

## Notes

The original config file can be bound in the `node-modules` directory under`~foundation-sites/scss/foundation.scss`.
